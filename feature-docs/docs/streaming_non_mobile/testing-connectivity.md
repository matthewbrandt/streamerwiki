# Testing Connectivity

Figuring out if your connection and settings are sufficient and correct.

## Twitch Inspector
This [free tool from Twitch](https://inspector.twitch.tv/) will allow you to view your bitrate, encoder, resolution and more for any stream, even a currently-running one.

## Test Mode
By adding the `?bandwidthtest=true` to the end of the Twitch Ingest URL, you can simulate a livestream without actually going live or notifying viewers. OBS and other software have functionality to do this automatically when a checkbox is checked.
