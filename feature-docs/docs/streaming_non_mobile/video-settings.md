# Video & Bitrate
Video settings, resolutions and bitrates.

## Bitrate
The maximum supported bitrate is 6000 kbps. Bear in mind that the audio & video bitrate together will be the total bitrate sent to Twitch.

## Maximum Resolution
Twitch recommends sending up to 1920x1080 (1080p/FullHD) at 60fps. If you send higher resolutions your stream is not guaranteed to display correctly, but if so the video will be transcoded to a lower quality.

## Minimum Resolution
Sending less than 480x360 (360p) at 30fps to Twitch may result in your stream not displaying correctly.
