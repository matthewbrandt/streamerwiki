# Audio & Bitrate
Audio settings and bitrates.

## Bitrate
The maximum supported bitrate is 160 kbps (per audio channel). Bear in mind that the audio & video bitrate together will be the total bitrate sent to Twitch.

## Codec
AAC-LC, stereo or mono channels.

## Sampling Frequency
Any (AAC codec).

## Audio Tracks
A stream can contain a primary audio track as well as a "VOD Track" to Twitch. The "VOD Track" will be included on the livestream, but when the VOD is played back the audio won't be included. You can find a detailed guide on how to do this in OBS [here](https://obsproject.com/kb/twitch-vod-track-guide).
