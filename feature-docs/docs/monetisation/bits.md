# Bits
Details about Twitch's proprietary on-platform currency.

## Mobile Surcharge
Due to Apple and Google App Store fees, purchasing Twitch Bits on mobile devices is significantly more expensive than on desktop.

## For Creators
In the creator dashboard, there are four settings that can be adjusted.

**N.B.: The Minimum Bits to Cheer cannot be less than the Minimum Bits to Pin a Cheer.**

### Minimum Bits to Cheer
Set the minimum number of Bits needed to send a Cheer message in the channel. Twitch recommends setting this above 1 to combat spam in chat. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 100'000.

### Minimum Bits Emote
Set the smallest Bit Emote that can be used in the channel. Twitch recommends setting this above 1 to combat spam in chat. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 100'000.

### Enable Pinned Cheers
A toggle that allows creators to enable or disable Cheers that are fixed to the top of the chat window on both desktop and mobile.

### Minimum Bits to Pin a Cheer
Set the minimum number of Bits needed to pin a Cheer (must be enabled to be enforced). Twitch recommends setting this above 1 to combat spam in chat. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 100'000.


## For Viewers
### Purchasing Bits
Bits will be shown in a localised price to your region. Twitch determines your region with a variety of factors and variables that are unknown. You can only buy set denominations of bits, with larger amounts offering a price discount:
- 100
- 500
- 1500 (5% discount)
- 5000 (8% discount)
- 10'000 (10% discount)
- 25'000 (12% discount)

During checkout, you can select a larger quantity of the denomination selected to buy amounts different to the ones offered (i.e. 8 x 100 bits). The minimum purchase amount is currently 100 and the maximum 125'000 bits.

### Spending Bits
By using the chat functionality, you are able to cheer anywhere from 1 to 5'499'951 bits in a single message. However, some creators may have set a larger [minimum amount to cheer](/docs/monetisation/bits#minimum-bits-to-cheer).

### Bits History
You can see how many bits you have cheered in what channels by following the link [here](https://www.twitch.tv/wallet?tab=bits-usage-history).

### Holding Bits
Technically there is no limit on the amount of bits that can be held in your wallet.
