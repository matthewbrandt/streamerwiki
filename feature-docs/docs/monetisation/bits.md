# Bits
Details about Twitch's proprietary on-platform currency.

## Mobile Surcharge
Due to Apple and Google App Store fees, purchasing Twitch Bits on mobile devices is significantly more expensive than on desktop.

## For Creators
In the creator dashboard, there are four settings that can be adjusted.

**N.B.: The Minimum Bits to Cheer cannot be less than the Minimum Bits to Pin a Cheer.**

### Minimum Bits to Cheer
Set the minimum number of Bits needed to send a Cheer message in the channel. Twitch recommends setting this above 1 to combat spam in chat. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 100'000.

### Minimum Bits Emote
Set the smallest Bit Emote that can be used in the channel. Twitch recommends setting this above 1 to combat spam in chat. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 100'000.

### Enable Pinned Cheers
A toggle that allows creators to enable or disable Cheers that are fixed to the top of the chat window on both desktop and mobile.

### Minimum Bits to Pin a Cheer
Set the minimum number of Bits needed to pin a Cheer (must be enabled to be enforced). Twitch recommends setting this above 1 to combat spam in chat. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 100'000.
