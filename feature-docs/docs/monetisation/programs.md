# Twitch Programs
Information concerning Twitch's programs "Turbo" and "Amazon Prime Gaming".

## Mobile Surcharge
Due to Apple and Google App Store fees, purchasing either Twitch Turbo or Amazon Prime Gaming subscriptions on mobile devices is significantly more expensive than on desktop.

## Twitch Turbo
Turbo is a monthly subscription program offered on Twitch. Turbo subscribers receive the following benefits:
- Ad-free Viewing on Twitch: Turbo subscribers do not see video or banner ads, except as part of channel sponsorships. Turbo subscribers may still see streamer-enabled promotions on channels and Twitch-promoted content on non-channel pages.
- Expanded Emoticon Set: 2 additional sets of emoticons: Glitch or monkeys.
- Custom Chat Username Colours: Custom username color, based on 3 sliders or a hex code.
- Chat Badge: Exclusive Turbo badge for Twitch chat.
- Extended Broadcast Storage: Creators can save their past broadcasts on Twitch for 60 days instead of the standard 7 days (non-affiliate) or 14 days (affiliate).

## Amazon Prime Gaming
Prime Gaming is included with Amazon Prime and Prime Video memberships. Prime Gaming includes:
- bonus games and exclusive in-game content
- a channel subscription every month at [no additional cost](/docs/monetisation/programs#prime-gaming-subscription)
- exclusive emotes
- chat badge

### Prime Gaming Subscription
Every Prime Gaming member will receive a channel subscription at no additional cost to give to the Twitch Partner of their choice every month. This option is visible when they click the Subscribe button on a Partnered or Affiliated channel. Prime Gaming is available globally, with the exception of India, China and embargoed territories.

All creators, regardless of where they live, will be paid for Prime subscriptions to their channel in the same manner as regular subscriptions. **The revenue share remains the same for Prime subscriptions as it is for normal subscriptions.**

Prime channel subscriptions do not auto-renew. In order to remain subscribed to a particular channel, a viewer will need to manually use their Prime subscription on that channel each month. Prime Gaming revenue is paid out with the rest of creator revenue on a NET 15 schedule.
