# Moderation
Moderation of messages, both automated and manual.

## Automatic Moderation (AutoMod)
Twitch's built-in automatic moderation can be adjusted by the creator (or channel moderator) to catch messages before being shown in chat. You can read more details about the feature [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-automod).

### AutoMod Flags (Potentially Inappropriate)
If AutoMod believes a message to be inappropriate but isn't certain, it will hold the message and mark it in the chat window so that the creator or moderator can approve or deny it. On denial the message is deleted, on approval it is posted to chat from the original author.

### AutoMod Blocked & Permitted Terms
Moderators and creators are able to add words to both blocked and permitted terms lists.

## Hyperlinks
A channel can be set to block hyperlinks. All hyperlinks (with the exception of Twitch-native clips or other links) will be blocked and appear as `***` in chat.

## Chat Delay
Creators and moderators can add a delay of 2, 4 or 6 seconds, before messages appear in chat for the public.

## Account Verification (Email & Phone)
Channels can be configured to only allow chatters who have verified either their phone number, email address or both. Exemptions can be made for subscribers, VIPs and moderators. More details can be found [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/chat-verification-settings).

## Moderation Actions
Moderators (and automatically creators) can enable moderation actions to be visible next to each message in chat. The icons for "ban", "timeout" and "delete" are then shown next to each message, with a single click able to execute that particular action.

## Chat Rules
Each channel can have a set of chat rules that must be accepted by a chatter before being able to type. Rules can be reviewed after being accepted by clicking the "chat settings" icon and selecting "view chat rules".
