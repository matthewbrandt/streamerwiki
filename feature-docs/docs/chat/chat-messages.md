# Chat Messages
All about Twitch Chat messages.

## Message Length & Supported Characters
You can send a chat message of up to 500 characters. You can use various character sets and languages, but some symbols and special characters are not shown correctly.

## Commands
Many channels use various types of "commands" on Twitch to allow viewers to obtain links, lookup information, play games or many more. There are two types of commands generally on Twitch.

### Slash Commands
The slash `/` commands are mostly reserved for creators, but some (e.g. `/mods`) are usable by viewers too. You can see the [full list of commands here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/chat-commands).

### Symbol Commands
Some channels have additional accounts (i.e. bots) watching their chat if someone types specific words with characters in front. Typically the `!` or `?` characters are used, for example `!commands` will return a message with a link or list of available commands.

## Reply Mode
Twitch has a small feature for repling or threading chat. You can click on the thread icon on the right-hand side of the message or use the keyboard shortcut `ALT` (Windows) / `OPTION` (Mac) + `ENTER` when the appropriate username is highlighted.

## Tagging & Highlighting Usernames
Using `@username` in the chat will automatically highlight the username for that particular user. The `@` symbol is optional as usernames are also highlighted without them.
