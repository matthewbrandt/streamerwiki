# Roles
Explanation of the different roles chatters can have.

## Functionality
Roles can be assigned to users using / (slash) commands or in the Roles Manager of the Creator Dashboard. Users can hold multiple roles at a time, but cannot be Moderator and VIP at the same time; assigning moderator rights will remove the VIP role.

## Types of Roles
### Editor
Editors can access a channel's dashboard and help you manage your channel by performing the following actions:
- Editing stream info
- Running commercial breaks
- Editing video info
- Uploading videos
- Starting reruns
- Downloading past broadcasts
- Reviewing, searching, sorting, and deleting (including mass deleting) clips
- Setting channel clipping permissions

### Moderator
Moderators help manage a chat to help ensure that it stays safe, welcoming, and fun by performing the following actions:
- Time out or ban users
- Enable slow, subscriber- and follower-only chat modes
- Start, manage, and end polls (if affiliated or partned)
- Start, manage, and end predictions (if affiliated or partned)

### VIP
VIPs are valuable members of a community who are recognised with a special badge. VIPs have the following abilities:
- Chat without being affected by slow, sub-only, or followers-only modes
- Chat without being affected by rate limits
- Post links in chat even when links are disabled

### Artist
Artists are members of a community who are recognised for their contributions to the brand/style of the channel, such as emotes, overlays, avatars and more. There are five (5) artist badges available for each channel.
