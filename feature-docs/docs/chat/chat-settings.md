# Chat Settings
Various settings about Twitch Chat.

## User List
Under the "Community" icon, the usernames of those present in the chat will be displayed. It is also possible to filter these in the search bar. The search is not case sensitive and parts of names can be searched. The list is automatically divided by role:
- Broadcaster
- Moderators
- Community VIPs
- Viewers

## Collapse Chat
On most devices, you can collapse the Twitch chat window. On the technical side, this will remove your username from the users present in chat (after a few minutes delay).
