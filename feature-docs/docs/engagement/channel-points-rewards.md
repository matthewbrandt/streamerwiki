# Channel Points Rewards
Setting up Channel Point (CP) rewards and management.

## Broadcaster Points
The broadcaster has unlimited channel points in their own channel.

## Limits and Costs
A creator may set up a maximum of 50 rewards, active or not. The minimum cost for a reward is 1 and the maximum cost 999'999'999. If a reward is redeemed and cannot be fulfilled, the creator can refund the CP back to the user - but only provided that the reward has not been set to "skip reward requests queue".

## Restrictions
Creators can force certain restrictions on rewards in order to make them more manageable.

### Require Viewer to Enter Text
A reward cannot be redeemed if the viewer does not enter text. There is no validation possible, therefore a viewer can also enter `.` and it will submit.

### Skip Rewards Requests Queue
If a reward skips the queue, it will be redeemed "automatically" and can therefore not be refunded.

### Redemption Cooldown
Redeems can be set to "cooldown" in minutes, hours or days, meaning that the redemption will be marked as "on cooldown" once redeemed. No users can bypass cooldowns - not even the broadcaster.

Attention: if the reward is refunded to the user the cooldown is **not** reset.

### Limit Redemption per Stream
A redeem can be set to only be redeemed a maximum of times per stream - there is no upper limit to this number. Restarting the stream in any way resets this counter.

### Limit Redemption per Stream
A redeem can be set to only be redeemed a maximum of times per stream per user - there is no upper limit to this number. Restarting the stream in any way resets this counter.

## Terms of Service
There are several key restrictions around the use of CP. Some of them include:
- you may not create rewards for tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceutical products, imitation currency, infant food and formula, bank operations, or fuel
- you may not purchase or exchange points outside of Twitch services
- you may not create rewards that constitute gambling
- you may not sell or otherwise trade points in exchange for bits, virtual or real currencies
